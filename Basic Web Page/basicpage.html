    <h2>Astonauts</h2>
    <p>~ ~ White suits floating in the void of space ~ ~</p>
    <p>1. The word "astronaut" comes from the Greek words "astron nautes" , which means "star sailor." <br>
        2. It is estimated that over 600 million people watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walk on the Moon on T.V. <br>
        3. Guion Bluford was the first African American in space. He began as a mission specialist on the Challenger in 1983. <br>
        4. Sally Ride was the first American woman in space. She was also the youngest American astronaut to travel to space. <br>
        5. Alan Shepard became famous for hitting a golf ball while on the Moon!<br>
        6. Astronauts wear diapers -- well technically called "Maximum Absorbency Garments." Missions are unpredictable and long, so when Astronauts can't unbuckle to go to the bathroom . . . well you get the gist. Luckily, they change their own garments. <br>
        7. Astronauts have to learn Russian to be on the International Space Station in order to read manuals on the Russian side, communicate and know what's going on!<br>
        8. Exercising in space is essential for preventing bone and muscle loss. On average, astronauts exercise for two hours a day on special equipment designed for space.<br>
        9. Astronauts can grow up to 3% taller while spending time in microgravity. When the astronauts return to earth, their height returns to normal after a few months.<br>
        10. Apollo 16 Astronaut Charles Duke left a photograph of his wife and their two sons sitting on a bench on the Moon. He signed the back of the photograph with a message saying “’This is the family of Astronaut Duke from Planet Earth. Landed on the Moon, April 1972.’” The photograph remains to this day.</p>

    <h2>Nebulae</h2>
    <p>~ ~ Clusters of colorful gasses - the birth of a star ~ ~</p>
    <p>1. Most nebulae contain the “stuff of stars and planets”, including gases, dust, and complex molecules. <br>
        2. As stars die and lose their materials to space, their gases and dust mix with clouds of gas, creating the complex nebulae we see.<br>
        3. Nebulae are always in motion, even though they look quiescent in images. The clouds mix and churn, which creates magnetic fields.<br>
        4. There are several types of molecular clouds: dark globules, emission nebulae, and reflection nebulae. Emission nebulae glow as their gases are heated. Reflection nebulae are mostly dust which reflects the light from nearby stars.<br>
        5. Our Sun and planets formed in a nebula some 4.5 billion years ago.<br>
        6. Nebulae exist in other galaxies. Astronomers have observed them in all spirals as well as the nearby Magellanic Clouds.</p>
