There are 4 total pages with 2 having the same layout for a total of 3 unique pages. The homepage has a link to the extra information and contact page in the upper right corner. Since there is no actual database or search functionality, clicking on the advanced search bar will lead to the first band information page. 
From there, there are hyperlinks to the contact and extra information page and the homepage. Every page has the hyperlinks in the top right corner and will also allow the user to return to the homepage upon clicking the logo in the top left corner. 
The second band information page is accessible from the homepage by clicking the "Name" cell in the 'Search by Group' table on the left side of the page. This is because there is no search function.
The band information page displays information about the band, members, and the songs on the band's albums. One page is for Distant while the other is for Humanity's Last Breath.
The extra info page provides information about metal sub-genres and explains why the website exists. There is also a contact section.
