            <h2><u>Genres</u></h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            <h2>- Metal -</h2>
            <span class="tab"></span>A genre of music characterized by distorted electric guitars, drums, and 
            changes in tempo. Countless sub-genre and mixtures of genre have emerged since heavy metals debut in the 60s and 70s.
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>- Death Metal -</h2>
            <span class="tab"></span>A larger sub-genre of heavy metal. The vocal style tends to be in the lower range, featuring
            growls instead of highs. Blast beats and tremolo picking are common instrunmental techniques. Song structures
            are complex and tempo changes often.
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>- Black Metal -</h2>
            <span class="tab"></span>A larger sub-genre of heavy metal. Similar to Death Metal, Black Metal uses blast beats and 
            tremolo picking. The tempo of black metal tends to be on the faster side and unlike death metal, the vocal style
            tends to be high in pitch. Another staple cue of black metal is the raw sounding recording and mixing.
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>- Metalcore -</h2>
            <span class="tab"></span>A sub-genre that infuses elements of melodic death metal and hardcore/punk. This genre
            is classified by its hardcore-like breakdowns paired with intsrumental melodies and clean and/or screams and growl-like vocals.
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>- Deathcore -</h2> 
            <span class="tab"></span>A sub-genre fusion of death metal and hardcore/punk. It fuses the structure and guitar
            riffs from death metal with the breakdowns from hardcore. Unlike metalcore, clean singing is not common and death metal
            blast beats are used often.
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>- Hardcore -</h2>
            <span class="tab"></span>A sub-culture and sub-genre of punk rock. Rock is not metal, however hardore has many influences in
            many metal sub-genres. It is similar to the rock genre, but is typically faster and more aggressive in nature.
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>- Progressive -</h2>
            <span class="tab"></span>A sub-genre that combines the complex structures and time signatures present in progressive rock
            with the instrumentation of heavy metal. The vocal styles usually lean towards melodic cleans.
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>- Downtempo -</h2>
            <span class="tab"></span>Like the name suggests, this can be added to other genres to further define a band or song's sound.
            For example, downtempo deathcore is similar to deathcore, however, as the song progresses, the tempo typically slows down.
